### ðŸ’¬ Independent Study & Support Time
#### Students
This is time for you to get help with whatever you need help with.

If you didnâ€™t understand something in the prep, ask about it.

If you were struggling with a coursework exercise, get help with it.

If you werenâ€™t quite sure of something in a workshop, discuss it.

If you donâ€™t have any problems, keep working through the coursework until you need help.

It can be useful to get into groups with others facing the same problem, or working on the same backlog item.

#### Volunteer Coaches
Donâ€™t be scared to approach people and ask what theyâ€™re working on - see if you can help them out, or stretch their understanding.

If lots of people have the same problems, maybe you can put together a demonstration or a workshop to help them understand.

If absolutely no one needs help, consider reviewing some PRs.
