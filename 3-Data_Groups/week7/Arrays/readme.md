#  Arrays Workshop
## Instructions

This workshop aims to _check your understanding_.

Each task will explain whether or not you should run the code.

For each task, you can use [Data Groups Week 7 prep](https://github.com/HackYourFutureBelgium/Intro-to-Programming/blob/main/3-Data_Groups/week7/1-preparation.md)
to help you with the questions.

You can also use documentation to look up any functions that are unfamiliar.

Don't use ChatGPT or any other AI tool to help you.
