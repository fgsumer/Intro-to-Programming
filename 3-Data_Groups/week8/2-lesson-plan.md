# Objects Workshop
## Instructions
This workshop aims to _check your understanding_.

Each task will explain whether or not you should run the code.

For each task, you can use [Data Groups Week 8 prep](https://github.com/HackYourFutureBelgium/Intro-to-Programming/blob/main/3-Data_Groups/week8/1-preparation.md) to help you with the questions. 

You can also use documentation to look up any functions that are unfamiliar. 

Don't use ChatGPT or any other AI tool to help you.

## üß∞ Setup
1. Get into pairs or groups of up to three.
2. Make sure you have [a fork of the Intro-to-Programming repo](https://github.com/HackYourFutureBelgium/Intro-to-Programming) repository on your local machine
3. This workshop can be found in this path : `3-Data_Groups/week8/Objects`
4. You should start this project at **Level 100** and then move through the levels in ascending order, **level 200**, **300** etc.

## üí¨ Independent Study & Support Time
#### Students
This is time for you to get help with whatever you need help with.

If you didn‚Äôt understand something in the prep, ask about it.

If you were struggling with a coursework exercise, get help with it.

If you weren‚Äôt quite sure of something in a workshop, discuss it.

If you don‚Äôt have any problems, keep working through the coursework until you need help.

It can be useful to get into groups with others facing the same problem, or working on the same backlog item.

#### Volunteer Coaches
Don‚Äôt be scared to approach people and ask what they‚Äôre working on - see if you can help them out, or stretch their understanding.

If lots of people have the same problems, maybe you can put together a demonstration or a workshop to help them understand.

If absolutely no one needs help, consider reviewing some PRs.
